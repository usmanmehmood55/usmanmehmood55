I'm a mechatronics engineer by heart, and an embedded software engineer by
profession. Currently working on safety critical applications, making reliable
and safe devices.

I've got 5 years of experience in embedded software, IoT systems, PCB design,
and CAD design. I also develop .NET desktop and backend applications. And
recently I have started writing web apps in JavaScript as well.

I graduated from [Air University Islamabad](https://www.au.edu.pk/) with
a bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering.
